**** Convert Any Base to Dec ****

Least significant digit corresponds to AnyBase^0 = 1 (2^0 in Bin).
Next digit corresponds to AnyBase^1.
Next digit corresponds to AnyBase^2, etc.
Multiply each digit's value by its corresponding AnyBase^x and sum the results.

Example:

F6A in base 16 to Dec:

A * 16^0 = A * 1 = 10 * 1 = 10
6 * 16^1 = 6 * 16 = 96
F * 16^2 = F * 256 = 15 * 256 = 3840

10 + 96 + 3840 = 3946 in Base10
