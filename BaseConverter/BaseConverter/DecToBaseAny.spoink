**** Convert Dec to Any Base **** 

Divide with reminder: input divided by new base (2 in Bin).
Store the reminder. 
Quotient becomes new input, repeat until quotient is 0.
Stored numbers are the digits in new base.

Example:

3946 to base 16:

3946 / 16 = 246 | 10
246 / 16 = 15 | 6
15 / 16 = 0 | 15

Digits: 15, 6, 10 = F6A in Base16
